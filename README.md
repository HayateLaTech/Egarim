# /create with Bun runtime

A [slash-create](https://npm.im/slash-create) template, using [Bun runtime](https://bun.sh).

## Getting Started

### Cloning the repo

```sh
bun create discord-interactions interactions-bot
```

### Development

To run this locally, rename `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in the variables, then run `bun run.js` to start a local dev environment and use something similar to [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) or [cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/) to tunnel it to a URL.
